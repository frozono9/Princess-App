# Princess Card Trick - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** July 29, 2025

## **Information We Collect**
Princess Card Trick is designed to protect your privacy. We collect minimal information:

- **App Usage Data**: We store only basic app preferences locally on your device (such as whether you've completed the onboarding)
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personal identifiers
- **No Location Data**: We do not access or store your location information

## **How We Use Information**
The limited data we store is used solely to:
- Remember your app preferences
- Provide a seamless user experience
- Maintain app functionality across sessions

## **Data Storage**
- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults
- No information is transmitted to external servers
- No cloud storage or remote databases are used

## **Third-Party Services**
When you tap the Notes app to view the tutorial, you may be redirected to YouTube. YouTube has its own privacy policy that governs that interaction.

## **Data Security**
Your data is protected by iOS's built-in security features. Since all data remains on your device, it benefits from your device's security settings.

## **Children's Privacy**
Our app is suitable for all ages and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## **Changes to Privacy Policy**
We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be posted with a new effective date.
